## 🚀 Start Here

When I began learning Bash, I didn’t try to memorize commands or copy scripts blindly.

Instead, I rebuilt very simple scripts **line by line** and asked questions at every step:

- What is this line?
- Why is it here?
- What happens if I remove it?
- What breaks if I change it?

If I didn’t understand something, I looked it up (Google, ChatGPT, docs), then came back and rebuilt the script from scratch.

This approach helped me understand **how scripts actually work**, not just what they output.

If you’re new, I recommend starting with:
- [Understanding a Simple Bash Script Skeleton](notes/script_skeleton.md)

Use it as a reference, rebuild it by hand, and don’t rush.
