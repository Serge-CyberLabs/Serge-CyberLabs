📘 CompTIA A+ Study Notes

📌 Repository Purpose
This repository contains my personal study notes used while preparing for and passing the CompTIA A+ certification exams (Core 1 & Core 2).
These notes were created while reading the Mike Meyers All-in-One CompTIA A+ Certification Exam Guide (11th Edition) and are organized chapter by chapter to reflect my actual learning process.
The goal of this repo is to:

- Reinforce my own understanding
- Demonstrate consistent study habits to employers
- Help other beginners navigate A+ topics more confidently

⚠️ These notes are not a replacement for the official study guide or exams. They are summaries, explanations in my own words, and learning checkpoints.

🧠 How These Notes Were Created
Primary resource: Mike Meyers All-in-One A+ Study Guide (11th Edition)

Supplemented with YouTube videos by:
- Professor Messer 
- Burning Ice Tech 
and
- Hands-on labs and practice

Notes were written:

- In plain language
- With beginner clarity in mind
- Focused on understanding, not memorization

I avoided copying copyrighted material and instead focused on:

- Key concepts

- Practical examples
- Exam-relevant reminders
